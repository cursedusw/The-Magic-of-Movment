This is only the code

This project was made for my final in my Systems development class. It is very rough to look at, but the graphics were not the objective of the project.  The project  objective was to create an application and go throughout the steps of the development life cycle. i chose a video game because it has been what i use  to practice programming.  

DISCLAIMER: Not all of the code in this is of my own creation. i used parts of a previous project that i made when first learning to code. Some of the code is  from basic Youtube tutorials and other online tutorials with parts that i have added to make it fit the game.
